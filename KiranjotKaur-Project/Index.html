							Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. 
							In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations
							 that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues,
							  custards, and pies.The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or 
							  margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional 
							  ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as 
							  vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit
							   preserves, nuts or dessert sauces
							 (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders,
							  or candied fruit.

						The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".

						The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis).
						It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a 
						flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" which was derived from the Greek term.
						A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.

						The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk. In
						ancient Rome, the basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet 
						and cake-like baked good. Latin poet Ovid refers to his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first 
						book of exile, Tristia.
						<br><br><br>
						Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread"
						 were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, 
						 while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.
